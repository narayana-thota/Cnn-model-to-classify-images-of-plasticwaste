♻️ Waste Management Using CNN Model 🧠

📌 Overview

This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for waste management. The goal is to classify images of waste items into different categories, such as Organic, Recyclable, and various types of plastic waste. The model leverages deep learning techniques to extract features from images and use those features for accurate classification. This approach aims to automate the waste sorting process, making it more efficient and precise. 🚀

📅 This Week's Work

During this week, the following tasks were completed:

📊 Data Preparation:

📥 Collected and preprocessed the dataset from the TRAIN and TEST directories.

📏 Images were resized and normalized before being fed into the model.

🔄 Data augmentation using the ImageDataGenerator was applied for better model generalization.

🏗 Model Architecture:

Designed a CNN architecture with the following layers:

🧩 Convolutional layers with ReLU activation

📉 Max pooling layers for downsampling

🎛 Fully connected layers for classification

🚧 Dropout layers for regularization

✅ The final output layer used a softmax activation to classify multiple categories of waste, including various plastic types.

🎯 Model Training:

🏋️ Trained the model for multiple epochs using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.

📦 Used batch size of 256 for training.

📊 Visualization:

🥧 Displayed a pie chart showing the distribution of labels in the dataset.

🖼 Plotted random sample images from the dataset to visually check their labels.

📈 Visualized training and validation loss/accuracy curves.

🔍 Generated a confusion matrix to evaluate classification performance.

📏 Performance Metrics:

📊 Evaluated the model on the validation set to track accuracy and loss.

📌 Measured precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model’s effectiveness.
